The webpages for the introduction, the first unit,
the second unit and the third unit are all complete
with the required images, however, I still have to 
add some external content links to these webpages.
At present I am working on the webpage for the
fourth unit.

I added a slideshow for pictures on the home page
in addition to the previously completed webpages.
I have also added some web links for a few topics
in the first, second and third units. The fourth and
fifth units are under progress, I will complete them
in day's time or two.

DATE- 23 April 2020
The work on my website is complete. I have published
my website as https://parivesh-sood.github.io on github.
I have added navigation pane to surf between pages on 
the top as well as bottom of all the webpages. I have also
uploaded the syllabus document for the DAA subject on 
my website as well. Also, there is back to top button in 
every page.
I have primarily made use of HTML and CSS to complete
this website and all the images and  stuff are taken from 
various sources. I have taken a select few topics in each
unit to represent on my website.
Thank You.
